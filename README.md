# ðŸŽ©SubSnipeðŸŽ©
SubSnipe is a powerful Python tool designed to efficiently discover subdomains associated with a list of input domains. The tool utilizes the Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs to fetch subdomains from crt.sh and also leverages the Subfinder tool for even more comprehensive subdomain enumeration.

# ðŸŽ©Key Features:
+ Utilizes Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs to fetch subdomains from crt.sh for the provided domains.
+ Integrates with Subfinder for additional comprehensive subdomain discovery.
+ Provides a clean and user-friendly command-line interface.
+ Utilizes tqdm for progress visualization during subdomain enumeration.
+ Outputs the discovered subdomains to an output file for further analysis.

# ðŸŽ©Installation
Install the python modules
+ requests: This module is used to send HTTP requests to fetch data from the crt.sh website.
+ json: This module is used to handle JSON data retrieved from the crt.sh API.
+ sys: This module is used to access command-line arguments and exit the program if the arguments are not provided correctly.
+ subprocess: This module is used to execute the Subfinder tool as a subprocess to perform additional subdomain enumeration.
+ tqdm: This module is used to display a progress bar during the subdomain enumeration process to indicate the progress to the user.
  
If you do not have them , install using:
+ ```pip install requests```
+ ```pip install tqdm```
+ Please note that subfinder is a separate tool and not a Python module. You need to install Subfinder separately by following the installation instructions for your operating system from the official Subfinder repository: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder
+ Make sure your subfinder is properlly installed or add its absolute path at:
 
  ``` subprocess.run(['subfinder', '-dL', input_file, '-o', output_file])``` in the python file.
  
+ Now clone the repo and ```cd``` into the new folder or just download the python file.
  
  Ready to go!!
   
# ðŸŽ© Usage
```python3 script.py -f input_domains.txt -o output_subdomains.txt```

+ ```-f``` -  Specifies the .txt file with domains 
+ ```-o``` -  Specifies the .txt file where enumerated subdomains will be saved
